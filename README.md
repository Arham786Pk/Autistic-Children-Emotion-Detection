ðŸŽ¯ Project: Children's Emotion Detection Using Pre-trained Deep Learning Models
This project focuses on detecting and classifying emotional expressions in facial images of children, with a particular emphasis on supporting autism-related research. It leverages transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained deep learning models on a specialized dataset.

ðŸ§  Objective
To evaluate and compare the performance of multiple pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in recognizing facial emotions in children, enabling emotion-aware systems useful in healthcare, education, and assistive technologies.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Name: Autistic Children Emotions - Dr. Fatma M. Talaat

Description: This dataset contains facial images of autistic children annotated with emotional labels such as happy, sad, surprised, angry, and neutral.

Format: Images are categorized into folders representing each emotion.

Purpose: Designed for emotion detection research, especially for applications involving children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Overview
Resized all images to match model input size (e.g., 224Ã—224).

Normalized pixel values to [0, 1] for better training performance.

Applied data augmentation techniques (rotation, zoom, flipping) to enhance model generalization.

Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

ðŸ§  Models Used
Five pre-trained CNN models were fine-tuned using transfer learning:

VGG16

DenseNet

MobileNet

Xception

ResNet

All models were trained and evaluated under consistent conditions for fair comparison.

ðŸ“Š Evaluation
Evaluation metrics included accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Models were evaluated on a validation dataset.

A comparative bar chart was plotted to showcase model performance.

âœ… Results
ðŸ“Œ MobileNet outperformed all other models, achieving the highest accuracy. Its balance between performance and computational efficiency makes it ideal for real-time and edge-based emotion detection systems.
